<p>Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student at <a href="http://www.useoul.edu/">Seoul National University</a>, majoring in electrical and computer engineering, advised by professor <a href="http://3d.snu.ac.kr/members">Young Min Kim</a>.
I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science with mathmatics as minor in SNU.
My long term research goal is to create a machine that can persistently understand the wide-range of the spatial world.
To do so, I work on 3D generative models, which implicitly learns the essential features of the space by generating one.
My current focus is on large-scale 3D generative models, which aims on constructing a scene beyond a single instance.</p>
