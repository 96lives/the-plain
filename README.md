# The Plain

_The Plain_ is a minimalist Jekyll theme, designed to focus on writing that really matters to you and your audience.
Everything else is just a distraction.
Nothing more other than useful and understandable information sharing.
This theme is best suited for a personal blog type, but not limited to that.

P/S: This theme is originally inspired by [Leonard Lamprecht's _leo_ theme](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io), thanks!
