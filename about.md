### About Me

Email: 96lives@{snu.ac.kr, gmail.com}

I'm a master's student at [Seoul National University](http://www.useoul.edu/), majoring in electrical and computer engineering, advised by professor [Young Min Kim](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/members).
I received my bachelor's degree in computer science with mathmatics as minor in SNU.
My long term research goal is to create a machine that can persistently understand the wide-range of the spatial world.
To do so, I work on 3D generative models, especially large-scale 3D generative models, which implicitly learns the essential features of the space by generating one.
