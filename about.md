### About Me

Email: 96lives@{snu.ac.kr, gmail.com}

I'm a researcher at [SNU](http://www.useoul.edu/) advised by Prof. [Young Min Kim](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/members) (currently fulfilling Korean Military service duty).
My current research goal is to create a machine that can percieve and learn the geometry of the spatial world that we live in and re-design a better one.
I believe that this is crucial in terms of 1) it's application, automating the design process of geometry that is useful to us, such as furnitures, tools, etc. 2) AI, which I think one of the greatest thing about human intelligence is the usage of tools.
To do so, my main research focus has been on 3D generative models, especially a framework name Generative Cellular Automata (GCA), which iteratively deforms a shape locally to produce target geometry in a spatially scalable way.
<!-- To do so, my main focus has been on 3D generative models, which implicitly learns the essential features of the space by generating one.-->

I was fortunate to recieve my master's degree advised by Prof. [Young Min Kim](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/members), and bachelor's degree in CS with math as minor in SNU.
I also spent wonderful time working as a research scientist intern at [NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab](https://nv-tlabs.github.io) advised by Prof. [Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/).
