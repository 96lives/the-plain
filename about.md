### About Me

Email: 96lives@{snu.ac.kr, gmail.com}

I'm a researcher at [Seoul National University](http://www.useoul.edu/) advised by Prof. [Young Min Kim](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/members) (currently fulfilling Korean military service duty).
My research goal is to create a machine that can perceive and learn from the geometry of the spatial world that we live in and design a "better" one.
I believe that this is crucial in terms of 1) it's application, automating the design process of geometry (from everyday tools and furnitures to structures in architecture) that we leverage, and 2) building an AI system, which I think one of the greatest thing about human intelligence is the usage of tools.
To do so, my main research focus has been on 3D generative models.
Especially, I've been developing a generative model named Generative Cellular Automata (GCA), which iteratively deforms a shape locally to produce a new shape in a spatially scalable way.
<!-- To do so, my main focus has been on 3D generative models, which implicitly learns the essential features of the space by generating one.-->

I was fortunate to recieve my master's degree advised by Prof. [Young Min Kim](http://3d.snu.ac.kr/members), and bachelor's degree in CS with math as minor in SNU.
I also spent wonderful time working as a research scientist intern at [NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab](https://nv-tlabs.github.io) advised by Prof. [Sanja Fidler](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/).
