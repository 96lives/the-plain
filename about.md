I'm an undergraduate student at [SNU](http://www.useoul.edu/), majoring in [Computer Science](https:cse.snu.ac.kr). I'm highly interested in computer vision, specifically in spatial perception. My goal is to create practical algorithms in computer vision, that can be proven rigorously, while admiting the ambiguity that lies in visual data.
